<h4>The War On Drugs: A Deeper Understanding - 7/10</h4>
<h5>I think this album has a great sound throughout, tons of reverb with lots of space while maintaining some rhythm throughout most of the songs. It seems like many indie rock artists try to go for reverb heavy sounds but get lost in the space and cant keep the songs going<br /><br />


I also really instrumentation used, the drums sound good, the lead guitar tone is quite buzzy but it works great for the songs and the synth sounds are great lead tones.

It feels like every song on this album is propelled along by a wave of synth and guitar that makes it sounds huge.

The highlight of this album has to be the reverby harmonica solos on some of the songs, they are very Bruce Springsteen Nebraska era and bring a lot to every song theyre in.

Overally 7/10, Could be a potential 8/10, I dont feel like most of the album is catchy enough for me to go back and listen to consistently which would give it the 8/10.
