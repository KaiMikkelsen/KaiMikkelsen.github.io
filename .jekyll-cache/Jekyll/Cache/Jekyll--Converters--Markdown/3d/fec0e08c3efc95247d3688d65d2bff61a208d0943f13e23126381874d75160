<h4>BORNS: Blue Madonna &amp; Dopamine - 5/10</h4>

<h5>Both these albums have a solid sound and I think there is potential there for the sound BORNS has.<br /><br />

Most songs arent too memorable although there are a few catchy tunes throughout both albums.<br /><br />

Favorite Song(s): I Don't Want U Back<br /><br />
