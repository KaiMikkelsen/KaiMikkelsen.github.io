<h4>The War On Drugs: A Deeper Understanding - 7/10</h4>
<h5>I thought think album has a great sound throughout, tons of reverb with lots of space while maintaining some rhythm throughout most of the songs. It seems like many indie style artists try to go for reverb heavy sounds but get lost in the space and cant keep the songs going<br />
